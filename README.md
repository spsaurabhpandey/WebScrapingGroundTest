# WebScrapingGroundTest
This repository contains artifacts related to test automation assignment project to test login functionality. The test cases were automated using ROBOT Framework(which is based on Selenium and therefore I used Keywords from Selenium2Library).

1) The "WSTG_TestResults.docx" file contains the screenshots of the ROBOT IDE and also of the successful test report.
2) WSTG_TestSuiteLogin -> this text file contains the scripts of the automation test cases, which can be compiled using the RIDE tool.
3) "Test Results.zip" -> contains the Report and Log generated by the framework in html format.
